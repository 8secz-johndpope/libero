#### Description

It is really hard to exercise and get fit in our daily lives, and many people have approached this problem in many different ways. Some focus on running, others on swimming, and so on. With so many variations of fitness programs and products, it’s hard to know where to start. More importantly it can be challenging to motivate oneself to even do something as simple as downloading a bunch of apps and configuring them to you.

Libero is a simple solution that makes exercise easier and more FUN. It will provide an interface for people to get fit, have fun, and, most importantly, do it with other people. This app will allow strangers to connect through the app and compete together in real-time so that you’re not alone when exercising and there is a drive of motivation with the competitive vibe.   A project in 16S at DALI focused on running with a partner to train for a race or the like, and Libero has a very similar structure, although it will not discriminate against other forms of exercise and won’t partner people for as long encouraging quick games.
